.. function:: signatures(daily: Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series], precipitation: Optional[pd.Series] = None, title: Optional[str] = None, title_ypos: float = 1.02, figsize: Tuple[int, int] = (14, 13), threshold: float = 0.001, output: Optional[Union[str, Path]] = None) -> None

   Plot hydrological signatures with w/ or w/o precipitation.

   Plots includes daily, monthly and annual hydrograph as well as
   regime curve (mean monthly) and flow duration curve. The input
   discharges are converted from cms to mm/day based on the watershed
   area, if provided.

   :param daily: The streamflows in mm/day. The column names are used as labels
                 on the plot and the column values should be daily streamflow.
   :type daily: pd.DataFrame or pd.Series
   :param precipitation: Daily precipitation time series in mm/day. If given, the data is
                         plotted on the second x-axis at the top.
   :type precipitation: pd.Series, optional
   :param title: The plot supertitle.
   :type title: str, optional
   :param title_ypos: The vertical position of the plot title, default to 1.02
   :type title_ypos: float
   :param figsize: Width and height of the plot in inches, defaults to (14, 13) inches.
   :type figsize: tuple, optional
   :param threshold: The threshold for cutting off the discharge for the flow duration
                     curve to deal with log 0 issue, defaults to :math:`1^{-3}` mm/day.
   :type threshold: float, optional
   :param output: Path to save the plot as png, defaults to ``None`` which means
                  the plot is not saved to a file.
   :type output: str, optional

.. function:: prepare_plot_data(daily: Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]) -> PlotDataType

   Generae a structured data for plotting hydrologic signatures.

   :param daily: The data to be processed
   :type daily: pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame
   :param ranked: Whether to sort the data by rank for plotting flow duration curve, defaults to False.
   :type ranked: bool, optional

   :returns: Containing ``daily, ``monthly``, ``annual``, ``mean_monthly``, ``ranked`` fields.
   :rtype: NamedTuple


.. function:: cover_legends() -> Tuple[ListedColormap, BoundaryNorm, List[float]]

   Colormap (cmap) and their respective values (norm) for land cover data legends.


.. function:: exceedance(daily: Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]) -> Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]

   Compute Flow duration (rank, sorted obs).
